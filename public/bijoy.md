Career Objective: 
To leverage my field-based research experience, data management expertise, and community 
engagement skills as a Technical Officer at Arannayk Foundation, contributing to the conservation of big 
cats and their habitats in the Chittagong-Lushai transboundary landscape. I am driven by a commitment 
to biodiversity protection and sustainable community livelihoods, and am eager to apply my technical 
capabilities to wildlife monitoring, habitat restoration, and evidence-based conservation initiatives. 
I bring practical experience in rigorous field data collection, participatory community methods (FGD, KII), 
systematic documentation, and data quality assurance, skills directly transferable to species monitoring, 
camera trapping protocols, and MEAL framework implementation. My background in managing field 
teams in remote environments, coupled with proficiency in digital survey tools (SurveyCTO, ODK), data 
analysis (Stata, Power BI), and workflow automation, positions me to support effective project 
coordination, donor reporting, and adaptive management. 
While my experience originates in socioeconomic research, I am committed to rapidly acquiring 
specialized conservation knowledge—including camera trapping techniques and habitat monitoring 
protocols—to deliver meaningful impact in protecting Bangladesh's critical wildlife corridors and 
empowering indigenous communities in the Chittagong Hill Tracts.

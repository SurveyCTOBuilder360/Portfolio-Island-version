for years websites have followed the same formula flat two-dimensional designs that while functional often feel static and uninspiring but the web is evolving 3D websites are here transforming the way we experience the internet they bring depth movement and interactivity drawing users in and making every scroll and click feel immersive but here's the challenge when people hear 3D design they often think of complex software steep learning curves and heavy coding what if I told you that creating a stunning full F interactive 3D website is easier than you think no Advanced coding no complicated 3D modeling just a simple streamlined process that anyone can follow in this step-by-step tutorial I'll show you how to seamlessly integrate a 3D element into a real website using only HTML CSS and spline ensuring it's fully responsive and optimized for all devices if you're a developer or know someone who would love this share this video with them and if you find this helpful don't forget to like And subscribe your support helps us keep creating awesome content now without further Ado let's dive [Music] in to get started with this project you'll need an image which you can download directly from the GitHub repository the link is in the description below just head over to the repository and if you'd like to support the project don't forget to give it a star once you're there click on the image and you'll see the option to download it now once you have the file open your code editor of choice and simply drag and drop the project folder into it I'll be using visual studio code but feel free to use any editor you're comfortable with let's begin by setting up the necessary files first create an HTML file and a CSS file as these will be the foundation of our project inside the HTML file start by setting up a basic structure including the necessary elements like the head and body sections then um make sure to link your CSS file inside the head section so that all the styles are applied correctly once everything is set up open the project with live server to see the changes in real time as we build all right let's dive in and start adding some elements to our website inside the body tag we'll be working to create a modern lighting gradient effect for the top right section of our project first we'll need an image element to display the gradient go ahead and add an IMG tag then link it to the gradient image by setting the SRC attribute to point to this file below the image element let's add a div with the class name layer blur this will help us create a glowing effect around our gradient with the HTML structure in place we can move on to the styling open up your CSS file and the first thing we'll do is remove any default margins and padding that browsers typically applied by default next let's apply a more predictable Box model by setting box sizing to border box which ensures that padding and borders are included in the total width and height of elements now let's focus on styling the body of the page for the font family we'll use apple system blink Mac system font which gives us a clean modern system font that's optimized for various devices next let's set the background color of the body to Black to create a dark Sleek canvas for the rest of the design we'll also change the default text color to a light gray so it's easy to read against the dark background for the layout we'll set the Min height to 100 VH ensuring that the page takes up at least the full height of the viewport no matter the content and to improve the readability of the text we'll set a default line height of 1.5 now that we've set up the structure let's move on to styling the gradient image to Target it in our CSS we first need to give the image element a class so head back to your HTML file and add the class name image gradient to the IMG element once we've done that we can head to the CSS file and start styling so we'll set its position to Absolute this allows us to precisely control where it sits on the page then we'll adjust the top and right properties to zero ensuring it's aligned perfectly in the top right corner of the viewport to make the gradient image blend nicely we'll reduce its opacity to white5 which gives it a more subtle layered effect finally we need to make sure the gradient image stays behind all other elements on the page next let's target the layer blur class this is the element that will give us a glowing effect around the gradient we'll set its height to zero and width to 30 REM so it remains invisible but we can still apply some cool visual effects now we'll position it absolutely as well so we can control its exact placement set the top property to 20 cent to position it a little lower on the page and align it to the right with right zero to create the glowing effect we'll apply a box shadow that gives the div a soft blurred glow next let's apply a slight tilt by adding a 30° rotation using the rotate property this gives the effect a bit of angle and depth finally just like the gradient image we'll set the zindex of this layer blur element to minus fr with these Styles applied we now have a Sleek gradient background with a glowing blur effect to give the page a modern dynamic feel now let's move on to creating our navbar section head over to the HTML file and we'll start by adding a div with the class name container this will act as a wrapper to keep everything neatly structured inside this container we'll create a header element which will hold our navigation elements first let's build the logo add an H1 inside the header and give it a class last name of logo right below that we'll create a nav element which will contain four anchor tags these will be our navigation links labeled company features resources and docs making it easy for users to explore different sections of the website to complete the navigation we'll also add a signin button and give it the class name BTN signin which will allow users to log in quickly now that our structure is in place let's jump into the CSS to style our Navar first we'll Target the container class and set its width to 100% to keep it centered we'll apply a margin of zero for the top and bottom and set the left and right margins to Auto we'll also give it a relative position and set overflow to Hidden ensuring no content spills out unintentionally next let's St the header itself we'll set its display to flex to align elements horizontally use justify content space between to push the logo and navigation links to opposite ends and set align items Center to keep everything vertically aligned for spacing we'll apply one REM of padding on the top and bottom and five REM on the left and right ensuring good separation from other sections for the logo we'll remove its default margin increase the font size to three r and set its font weight to 300 for a Sleek lightweight feel now moving on to the navigation menu we'll set the nav element to display Flex align the items in the center and create some Breathing Room by adding a gap of three REM between links to slightly nudge the navigation closer to the logo we'll apply a negative left margin of magged 5% since the Navar should stay above other elements will give it a zindex of 999 actually let's apply this to the entire header to ensure all its contents remain on top for the anchor tags inside the nav will style them with a font size of one REM slightly increased readability with a letter spacing of 0.1 REM and apply a smooth transition for an elegant hover effect we'll also remove the text decoration by setting it to none ensuring clean minimal links and make sure that text color inherits from the body for consistency to add interactivity we'll create a hover effect so that when users hover over the links the text color subtly changes to gray enhancing the user experience now let's focus on the signin button we'll give it a light gray background set the text color to Black and apply a padding of point8 RM on the top and bottom and two r on the left and right making it feel more balanced to achieve a soft modern look we'll give it border radius 50px and remove the default border the font size will be set to one REM with a font weight of 500 keeping the text bold but not overwhelming we'll also add a transition effect on the background color and set cursor pointer to indicate it's clickable finally for the hover effect we'll make the background color shift to gray when hovered over providing a subtle but effective visual response and that wraps up our header section now let's move back to the HTML file and continue building our layout inside the container element right below the header we're going to create a new div with the class name content this section will hold the core elements of our hero area and set the foundation for a visually engaging design inside this content div we'll start by adding another div with the class name tag box this element will handle the Border gradient effect within the tag box we'll create a div with the class name tag which will contain the introductory text introducing followed by a character reference for a web bar shape to enhance its styling right below the tag box We'll add an H1 heading with the text email for us followed by a break element to start a new line and then the word developer next we'll create a paragraph element with the class name description this will serve as a short introduction to the platform giving users a quick overview of what the website is about moving further down We'll add another div with the class name buttons inside this we'll place two anchor tags which will act as interactive buttons one for the get started action and the other for the main sign-in process these buttons will improve navigation and enhance the user experience finally to keep our structure organized and semantic we'll wrap the entire content div inside a main element this ensures better accessibility and Clarity uh in our code with that our content section is fully structured now let's switch over to the CSS file and style these elements to bring everything to life in the CSS file let's begin by styling the main element to create a structured and Visually balanced layout set its display to flexx to enable flexible positioning of its child elements and Define the flex direction as column to stack elements vertically to ensure proper alignment set justify content to Center allowing the content to be perfectly centered within the section finally for a responsive height that adapts dynamically use Min height Cal 90 VH b a 6 REM uh ensuring the section takes up most of the viewport while accounting for spacing and layout balance let's move on to styling the content section to ensure a clean and modern look first target thecontent class and set its Max width to 40 REM ensuring it remains structured within a defined space adjust its positioning with a margin left of 10% giving it some offset from the edge for a balanced layout to make sure it appears above other elements assign it a zindex of 999 now let's focus on the uh tag box which will create a stylish animated gradient effect set its position to relative and Define its width as 18 RM and height as 2.5 RM to give it a Sleek rounded appearance apply a border radius of 50 PX for the background use a linear gradient that transitions smoothly from right to left ensuring the first and last colors match for a seamless Loop double the background size to 200% to enable a smooth animation effect now Now define an animation named gradient animation running infinitely over 2.5 seconds with a linear transition lastly add a soft box Shadow to enhance the depth to bring this animation to life Define the at Key frames for gradient animation gradually Shifting the background position to 200% creating a dynamic movement next styled a tag itself set its position to Absolute and use the inset property to keep it 3px away from the edges give it a black background and maintain the 50px Border radius for a rounded look set it to display Flex then use align them Center and justify content Center to perfectly Center its content both vertically and horizontally for smooth interactions add a 0.5s ease transition when hovered over the text color changes to purple adding a subtle yet modern touch and don't forget to set the cursor to pointer to indicate interactivity now let's refine The Heading H1 inside the content section increase its font size to four R and set the font weight to 600 show making it bold and prominent add a letter spacing of 0.1 em for better readability apply a two remem margin on the top and bottom while keeping the left and right margins at zero set a suash line height of 1.2 for proper spacing between lines and apply a soft box Shadow to subtly Elevate the text moving on to the description class set the font size to 1.2 REM keeping it readable and elegant add letter spacing of 05 M and limit its width with a Max width of 35 rim to prevent it from stretching too wide finally change its text color to gray for a softer contrast against the dark background now let's style the buttons class which holds two interactive buttons set it to display flex and add a one remem gap between the buttons for proper spacing for the get started button. BTN get started button tried first remove its text underline then apply a 1px solid border using a subtle heximal color set its padding to 7 Rem for top bottom and 1.2 REM for Left Right ensuring a comfortable button size add a sharp border radius of 50px for a smooth rounded appearance use a font size of 1.2 Rim set the font weight to 600 and apply letter spacing of 0.1 em to enhance readability for the hover effect change the background color to a lighter black shade making it visually engaging to make the transition smoother add a background transition effect before moving on to the next button let's add a margin top of three remem to the buttons class to create proper spacing and improve the layout the signin button. BTN signin follows a similar styling approach follow these steps carefully to get it just right however for the hover effect adjust the background color to gray creating a distinct contrast when interacted with now the real fun begins we're about to integrate a 3D robot model into our website and you'll see just how easy and exciting it is to bring this interactive element to life there are many incredible tools available for adding 3D elements to websites but today we're going to use one of the most powerful and user-friendly tools out there meet spline spline is a browser-based 3D design tool that allows you to create animate and even add interactivity to 3D objects without needing complex software in this tutorial I'll walk you through the entire process of adding a 3D element to your project step by step so you can see exactly how it works however if you want to explore spline in more depth there are plenty of fantastic tutorials available online to help you master even more advanced features to get started with spline the first thing you'll need to do is sign up for an account once you're in head over to to the sidebar and click on community here you'll find a ton of amazing 3D elements that other users have created you can open any of these projects and use the remix option to modify and customize the 3D elements however you like then use them in your own projects for today's tutorial we're going to work with a cute robot created by Victor when you open the project don't forget to like and comment on it to show your appreciation for for his awesome work once you click on the project you should see this screen where you can start remixing and modifying the 3D element here you can add or remove elements create different creative shapes add text circles cubes and a variety of materials you also have the ability to change the camera view add different lighting effects and even create animations for example this robot we're using actually follows your cursor however for the sake of time I'm going to skip this part for now if you want a more in-depth tutorial on how to use spline drop a comment below but like I said there are already so many great resources out there that explain it in detail for our project I've already prepared 3D robot and I've provided the link to it in the description box just head over there click on the link and you should see this page now that we have our 3D model the next step is to figure out how to actually add it to our website don't worry this process is super simple and I'll walk you through it step by step let's dive in first click on the remix button and wait for the page to load once it's ready click on the play button to preview the model and see how it behaves now head over to the export panel where you'll find different options to embed and share your 3D design from here select the public URL option and open the play settings panel in this section you'll see customization options like removing the spline logo but since that's a premium feature and we're using the free version the logo will remain visible no worries about that what we can do however is tweak other settings with the free version you can still hide the background enable or disable interactions like panning and zooming and adjust VAR other display settings once you've made your selections update your public URL next navigate back to the overview section and select the viewer option after waiting a few seconds you'll see an embed code go ahead and copy it now switch over to your code editor open your HTML file and paste this code inside the body tag below all other elements at this point if you open your project in the browser you should see the 3D robot displayed on your web page but what exactly is happening here when you export an embed code from spline it typically consists of two key elements the spline viewer element this is a custom HTML element provided by spline that embeds in displays the 3D model inside your web page it usually includes attributes like URL which link to your spline project and additional options such as touch action or interaction controls which let you adjust how users interact with the 3D model and the script element this script is responsible for loading the spline viewer Library ensuring that your 3D model renders correctly and remains interactive on your website without this script the spline viewer element won't function properly and that's it with just a few simple steps we've success sucessfully integrated a 3D model into our website now it's time to fix the position of our 3D model first take the spline viewer element and place it inside the container div then give it a class name of robot da 3D next switch over to your CSS file and Target this class set its position to Absolute and position it at the top zero to slightly hide the spline logo move it further to the right by setting right 9ish 20% and just like that our website is looking great the next step is to make it fully responsive for both tablets and mobile devices let's start with tablet optimization typically tablets have a width of less than 1300 pixels so we'll use a media query to adjust some elements for better display first Target the header and change it padding to one REM for top and bottom and 0.5 REM for left and right next adjust the content class by setting its margin top to 85% to push it further down lastly for the robot 3D class scale it down to 0.8 Move It Up by m 20 C and shift it slightly to the right by 2% now let's make it mobile friendly using another media query for devices with a width of less than 768 pixels will tweak several elements step by step to ensure everything looks perfect on smaller screens apply the following styles with precision and that's it great job now that our website is is fully responsive across all devices the Final Touch is to add smooth animations to enhance the user experience to achieve this we'll be using the AOS animate on scroll Library which will allow us to apply beautiful reload animations with minimal effort let's move on and set it up open your browser and search for aos.com on Google once you're on the website you'll see plenty of amazing scroll animation examples to use them you'll need to access the AOS library to do this head to the GitHub logo in the top right corner of the website and click on it this will take you to the GitHub repository for AOS scroll down the page until you find the basic setup section copy the code provided there and paste it into the head section of your HTML file then copy the script code and paste it into the body section of your HTML file just below all the other codes now the library is ready to use we'll start with a fade down animation for the H1 element inside the header simply copy the AOS code for fade down and add it to the H1 tag to make the animation smoother Define a duration of 1500 milliseconds now if you reload the project page you should see the animation in action next let's apply the same animation to all anchor tags inside the Navar but this time increase the duration by 500 milliseconds for a nice cascading effect and don't forget to add it to the sign-in Button as well now let's animate the content section and the 3D robot model scroll down on the AOS website until you find the section with different animation settings look for the fade zoom in in effect copy its code and apply it to the tag box inside the content section with a duration of 1500 milliseconds then copy and paste the same effect for the H1 element but increase the duration for a smoother transition do the same for the paragraph inside the content section setting the duration to 2500 milliseconds and finally apply it to the buttons again increasing the duration slightly for a better flow let's check the results reload the page and everything should animate beautifully oh looks like I made a little typo in the duration for the paragraph element let's correct that real quick finally let's apply the same fade zoom in animation to the spline viewer element so our robot gets a smooth reload effect when the page refreshes and that's it for the reload animations but there's just one small issue the hover effects on the elements inside the header are not working that's because we set a zindex of 999 on the header the fix is simple instead of applying the Z index to the entire header we should assign it specifically to the Anchor tags inside the navbar and the sign-in button this should solve the problem if you followed along and completed this project let me know in the comments below I'd love to hear your thoughts and if you have any suggestions on how I can improve the content quality feel free to share them also if you ran into any issues drop a comment and I'll do my best to help I'll be back soon with another exciting project stay tuned and take care
